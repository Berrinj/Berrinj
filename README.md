### Hi there, I'm Marte Lilleberre 👋
**And I'm a full-time Front End Developer Student**<br>
I am also a mother of 2 that works 80% in a kindergarten while on my path to change my occupation.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Social Media JavaScript school project 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and SASS
- 📫 How to reach me: berremarte@gmail.com
- 🎮 When I have some spare time I like to turn on my PS5(or Portal as that's more convient with kids around) or my Nintendo Switch.
- 🧩 I am a BIG Lego fan, and as a family we spend hours and hours building each week.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge Rihanna fan, and she follows me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rihanna.no)
