### Hi there, I'm Marte Lilleberre ðŸ‘‹
**And I'm a full-time Front End Developer Student**<br>
I am also a mother of 2 that works 80% in a kindergarten while on my path to change my occupation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [last exam at Noroff](https://github.com/Berrinj/Holidaze) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and TypeScript, plus recently downloaded Duolingo to learn French
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: berremarte@gmail.com
- ðŸŽ® When I have some spare time I like to turn on my PS5(or Portal as that's more convient with kids around) or my Nintendo Switch.
- ðŸ§© I am a BIG Lego fan, and as a family we spend hours and hours building each week.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge Rihanna fan, and she follows me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rihanna.no)
